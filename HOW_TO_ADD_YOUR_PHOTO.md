# How to Add Your Profile Photo

## Quick Steps:

1. **Get your photo ready**
   - Make sure it's a JPG/JPEG file
   - Recommended size: at least 400x400 pixels (square)
   - File size: under 2MB is best

2. **Rename it to: `shah-profile.jpg`**
   - The exact name is important!

3. **Copy it to the `public` folder**
   - Location: `Victus Launch\public\shah-profile.jpg`

## Where is the project folder?
- Full path: `C:\Users\offic\OneDrive\Desktop\Victus Launch`
- The `public` folder is inside this main folder

## Alternative: Using File Explorer
1. Open File Explorer
2. Navigate to: `OneDrive\Desktop\Victus Launch\public`
3. Drag and drop your photo into this folder
4. Make sure it's named `shah-profile.jpg`

## Need help locating the folder?
The dev server is running. Look at your terminal/command prompt - it shows the full path!

## After adding the photo:
- Save the file
- Refresh your browser
- Your photo should appear!

## Troubleshooting:
- **Photo not showing?** Make sure the filename is EXACTLY: `shah-profile.jpg` (lowercase, with hyphen)
- **Still not working?** Check browser console (F12) for errors
- **Wrong size?** That's okay! The CSS will crop it to fit
